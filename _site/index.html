                                            <p>Hey, I’m Wesley. I’m an IT technician and student at Ball State University, where I work in the Operations Control Center and study computer science. I have over 10 years of informal experience with the vicissitudes of designing and programming web UIs. Building on this experience to become a full-stack engineer is the aim of the current phase of my life. And, while I’m going to school part-time, I want to utilize my proficiency with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to get a job in web development.</p>

<p>I know that I face stiff competition. Bootcamps and universities constantly produce developers at or above my level. Their portfolios are better, their skillsets are more uniform, and they lack the idiosyncrasies and knowledge gaps that come with being self-taught, possibly giving employers more confidence in hiring a graduate. But being self-taught demonstrates a certain dedication to learning and self-improvement that following a curriculum in a class doesn’t require of a student. So, to showcase my skillset and become more well-rounded, I plan to design, develop and deploy several demo sites and web apps, a process that I will document in posts here.</p>
